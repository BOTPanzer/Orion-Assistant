Orion Assistant is a modulable assistant built with personalization in mind, written in HTML, CSS & JS and powered by Node.js & Electron.js
It's main purpose was to create a place where you could manage all your games but it has evolved to the point where it comes with 6+ different modules to do all kinds of things.

Some of these are:
- Library: manage your already installed games
- Store: find new games to play
- Themes Manager: personalize your assistant with custom themes
- Connect: connect to your assistant mobile app to send text
- Discord Rich Pressence: change your discord status to a custom game 
- Downloader: mass downloader of files from urls
- Installer: install compressed games with a click
- Pass Manager: saves and encodes all your passwords

Recent versions of the assistant also are capable of logging in and creating a backup of your settings to make updating easier.
